# Pixata.Blazor

I have [blogged about some Blazor components I've been writing](https://www.pixata.co.uk/tag/blazor/). This project contains the source for those components.

A [Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pixata.Blazor/) is available for this project.

## The components
Description coming soon...

## Warning
The package relies on the Telerik.Blazor Nuget package. If you don't have a subscription with Telerik, you can a 30-day trial version from them. I make no apologies for relying on this package, I have been using Telerik components for many years, and wouldn't develop without them.

At some point, I am going to split the project into two, one that relies on Telerik and one that doesn't, so anyone who is interested in using most of the components, but doesn't ahve a Telerik licence can do so.

## Sample project
I have added a [Blazor web project](https://github.com/MrYossu/Pixata.Utilities/tree/master/Pixata.Blazor.Test) to the repository, and intend to use that to try out and demonstrate the components. At the moment, it's a just-out-of-the-box template project, but should hopefully be expanded to include sample usage of the components.
