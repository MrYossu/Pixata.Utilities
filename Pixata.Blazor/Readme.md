I have [blogged about some Blazor components I've been writing](https://www.pixata.co.uk/tag/blazor/). This project contains the source for those components.

There is a [complimentary package](https://github.com/MrYossu/Pixata.Utilities/tree/master/Pixata.Blazor.TelerikComponents), which contains additional components for those who have a subscription to Telerik.

A [Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pixata.Blazor/) is available for this project.

## The components
Description coming soon...

## Sample project
I have added a [Blazor web project](https://github.com/MrYossu/Pixata.Utilities/tree/master/Pixata.Blazor.Test) to the repository, and intend to use that to try out and demonstrate the components. At the moment, it's a just-out-of-the-box template project, but should hopefully be expanded to include sample usage of the components.
