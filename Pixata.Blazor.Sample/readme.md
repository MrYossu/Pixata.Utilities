# Pixata.Blazor.Sample

>Apologies to anyone looking for the live version, or for examples of how to use the components in Pixata.Blazor. This project fell out of sync with the main package, and I haven't had the time to update it. I'd like to think that it will happen on day, but don't hold your breath 😎

This is the source code for a sample web project that uses the Blazor components. You can see a [live version of this sample](https://test.pixata.co.uk/), or [browse the source code](https://github.com/MrYossu/Pixata.Utilities/tree/master/Pixata.Blazor.Sample).
