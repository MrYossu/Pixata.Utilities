I seem to keep adding the same utility classes to every project I work on, resulting in (almost) identical code spread across different projects.

I used to get around this by maintaining the utilities in a separate project, and referencing the DLL. However, apart from being soooo 1990s, it also has problems like VS locking the DLL, preventing you from building the utility project and so on.

So, I decided to take a leap into the modern world, and try publishing a Nuget package. This is the first time I've done this, so goodness knows what's going to happen.

I stated off with some Blazor components that I've been developing recently. These are offered as-is, with no guarantee that they will work for you. I'm still working on them, and cannot offer much in the way of support, although I'd be very happy to receive any feedback you have.

## Documentation
I know, I really ought to document them. I probably will at some point, but haven't had time yet. I've made a start on the two project pages (see below), and will hopefully improve on this soon.

## Pixata.Extensions
Some useful utility classes and methods I've developed over the past few years. I have only put in a few so far, and the test project is woefully empty, but hopefully that will change over time. You can find more detail on the [project page](https://github.com/MrYossu/Pixata.Utilities/tree/master/Pixata.Extensions).

## Pixata.Blazor
I have [blogged about some Blazor components I've been writing](https://www.pixata.co.uk/tag/blazor/). This project contains the source for those components. You can find more detail on the [project page](https://github.com/MrYossu/Pixata.Utilities/tree/master/Pixata.Blazor).

## Blog
Random thoughts and notes that are sometimes useful, and sometimes related to these components can be found on [my blog](https://www.pixata.co.uk/).
