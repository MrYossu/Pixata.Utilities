This package complements the [Pixata.Blazor package](https://github.com/MrYossu/Pixata.Utilities/raw/master/Pixata.Blazor/), and adds components that rely on the Telerik components for Blazor. These were split off into their own package to enable those without a licence for Telerik to use the other components.

A [Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pixata.Blazor.TelerikComponents/) is available for this project.

## The components
Description coming soon...

## Warning
The package relies on the Telerik.Blazor Nuget package. If you don't have a subscription with Telerik, you can a 30-day trial version from them.

## Sample project
I have added a [Blazor web project](https://github.com/MrYossu/Pixata.Utilities/tree/master/Pixata.Blazor.Test) to the repository, and intend to use that to try out and demonstrate the components. At the moment, it's a just-out-of-the-box template project, but should hopefully be expanded to include sample usage of the components.
